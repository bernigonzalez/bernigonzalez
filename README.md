💻 Full Stack Web Developer

👋 I'm Bernardo and I became interested in programming when I started working at a bank and I was shown the world of data science: first as a Data Analyst and then developing machine learning models.

📚At the same time, I completed 70% of my degree in Economics where I learned a lot about willingness to study and teamwork. But, little by little, I ended up liking programming algorithms more than analyzing the results I obtained from them. Adding to the fact that I love creating things, I co-founded a Startup in the first years of college, I was encouraged to make a change in my career and do Henry's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp: extremely intensive but it opened me the doors to this fascinating industry. 

🖼 Front-end.
In front-end I develop with React and Redux. I have experience with CSS Styled Components and the Bootstrap framework. 

🗃 Back-end.
For the back-end, I use Node.js, with Express. For database management I'm familiar with Firebase and PostgreSQL, with Sequelize as ORM.

🧐I'm looking for my very first formal job as a developer. 

## · Project: Pokemon App - Henry Bootcamp 2022 ·

It's a SPA (single page application) developed as an individual project for Henry's Bootcamp.
For the front-end i used React and Redux. Styles were given using CSS, without using any libraries.
It consumes data from the API "pokeApi" through a back-end developed in Node using Express. The database was created using postgreSQL and Sequelize
